                        <p>These are the words I strive to live by, every single day. Who am I? I am a soul who can be seen as an athlete, learner, and explorer at heart. With a decade of experience as an International Rifle Shooter and a background in basketball, I'm constantly chasing new things that help me reveal more about who I am. I'm a granddaughter, daughter, sister, and wife, cherishing each role as I navigate my life's journey. Also somewhat academically driven because, to me, learning never stops. Here I am, giving a shot at sharing my adventures with you.</p>
